This project uses data scrapping from Google Play to obtain approximately 10,000 data applications on Google Play. This project will provide an overview of how the applications behave on Google Play, and how they will impact developers. After examining and cleaning up the data, a conclusion can be drawn:

- Categories that dominate on Google Play.
- What is the average ranking of the applications.
- How the size of the application and price affect the ranking.
- Do users prefer free / lightweight applications compared to paid / large sizes.
- What is the best pricing strategy.
- Sentiment polarity scores on free and paid applications.
